    researched ways to scrape data from job websites.  found out that all the apis that were previously available to individual people were deprecated in late 2010s.  Decided to go with Scraping - found a few web scrapers that I am researching further.

    also did some research on NLP libraries.  I'm not sure this is the appropriate route to take, so I will continue to do research to figure out what is best to do.

    well.  I have found octoparse, so it seems like that's what I'm going to go with.

    researching the best way to prompt chatGPT so that the results from the api call are the most consistent and accurate.
